    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the rice under the tap until clear, cover with cold water and let it soaks for a while.</li><br>

        <li>Cut the meat with bones into match-box pieces.</li><br>

        <li>Cut the carrots into 0.5x0.5 cm thick sticks.</li><br>

        <li>Slice onions into thin rings or half-rings.</li><br>

        <li>Clean heads of garlic from the remains of roots and dirt.</li><br>

        <li>Heat oil in the cattle or dutch oven on a very high flame, deep-fry meat until golden-brown, in 3-4 batches. Fry the onions until <br>
            golden, add meat to the cattle, stir well to prevent onion from burning. Add carrot, stir from time to time, until it starts to wilt <br>
            and browns a little (15-20 min). Add 2/3 of the cumin - rub it in your palms a little to release flavor, stir gentliy to keep carrot from broking.</li><br>

        <li>Lower gas to moderate, pour hot water just to cover all the goods, add salt and let it simmer for 40 min to 1.5 hours until <br>
            almost all water evaporate and meat became tender and juicy. Do not stir.</li><br>

        <li>Turn gas to max.</li><br>

        <li>Drain rice well, place it on top the meat and vegs in one layer, stick the garlic and whole chillies in it, and carefully pour <br>
            boiling water over it (place a spoon or ladle on top of the rice to keep the rice layer from washaway). Cover the rice with about 2 cm of water, <br>
            let it boil. Add salt to make the water a bit over-salted. When water will go down the rice, reduce the gas a bit, keeping it boils rapidly.<br>
             Check when it will evaporate and absorb into rice completely - rice should remain rather al dente. Make a holes in the rice to the bottom <br>
             of a vessel to check the water level.</li><br>

        <li>Reduce gas to absolute min, cover tightly with the lid and let it steam 20 minutes. Turn of the heat, remove the garlic and chillies <br>
            on the separate plate. Carefully mix rice with meat and carrots, if the rice tastes a bit blind add some salt, mix and let it stand for 5 minutes. <br>
            Pile the plov on a big warmed plate and serve with garlic, chilies and plain thinly sliced tomato-sweet onions-chili-salt salad.</li><br>
